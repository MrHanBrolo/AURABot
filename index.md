# Foreword
This Wiki and AURABot are still in development as of [02/10/2021]

This is not a Wiki for how to branch/develop your own bot using the repo for this bot. This is a guide on how AURABot commands work, and all its fun quirks that you may not know about but might stumble upon (nothing bad, I promise).

This Wiki also goes into FAR greater detail than is necessary to use the bot and in fact, you most likely will never need it as most commands are slash-based and contain descriptions for each action as well as Discord's built-in syntax for using it.
